      <h2>Space Apps Toronto 2013 Has Launched!</h2>
      <p>We’ve had an incredible weekend hacking alongside 9000 international participants working on 600 projects, in 80+ cities. On behalf of our organizing team both locally and internationally, we’d like to thank everyone who came out to the event to work on our 26 amazing projects!</p>
      <p>We feel honoured to have spent the weekend hacking with everyone, and are so proud of what everyone created together. You’ve all affected the way space data can be consumed and used in everyday life, made real research easier, and solidified Toronto’s place as one of the top Space Apps in the world.</p>
